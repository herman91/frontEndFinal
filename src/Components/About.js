                    <h2><strong>Matt Walton</strong></h2>
                    <p>Matt Walton became interested in cooking at a young age. He watched his father cook in the restaurants he worked in and his best friend’s father, who was also a chef. As Walton watched his role models cook, he developed a passion for the restaurant industry and knew he wanted to follow in their footsteps.
                    </p>
                    <p> Walton joined the Cameron Mitchell Restaurants (CMR) family in 2011 as a line cook at Marcella’s in the Short North. Walton transferred to the Cameron’s American Bistro team in 2013 in a variety of positions, including line cook, supervisor, sous chef and executive chef. Following a constant desire for innovation and a passion for locally produced food, he now serves as executive chef at the Guild House.
                        His greatest lesson learned while working in the restaurant and hospitality industry has been that with a great attitude, any situation can be overcome. He also advises those interested in pursuing a professional career as a chef to listen, work hard and stay humble.
                    </p>
                    <p>Walton resides in Clintonville with his wife, Jen, and their four dogs, Ari, Jack, Maggie and Jude.
                        When he’s not in the Guild House Kitchen, he enjoys home brewing wine and curing meats.
                        He earned a culinary arts degree from the Columbus Culinary Institute.
